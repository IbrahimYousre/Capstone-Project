## Key Considerations

### How will your app handle data persistence? 

The data will be saved in firebase realtime database and will be accessed by firebase sdk. Firebase will sync the data between the cloud and user device. Firebase cloud functions will be used to send a notification to the user when his questions receive a new answer. Firebase authentication will be used to insure secure access to data in the cloud.
I will use firebase job dispatcher to schedule a service to fetch the latest updates from the cloud every x hours.
Describe any edge or corner cases in the UX.

### Describe any libraries youâ€™ll be using and share your reasoning for including them.

The app will be written solely in Java programming language. Android studio 3.1.2 will be used for development, and its default gradle version is 4.4
I will target API version 27 and will use minSdkVersion of 19 and may adjust it to 21 if I needed to add advanced features later. I will use android support library v27.1.1
I will use glide library v4.7.1 for handling image loading and caching, timber v4.7.0 for logging. Also I will use android architecture components v1.0 stable.
I will use firebase jobdispatcher v0.8.5 for scheduling service

### Describe how you will implement Google Play Services or other external services.

The app will use admob to show ads. It will use identity to allow user to sign in with their google account.
